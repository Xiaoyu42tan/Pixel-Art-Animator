# Pixel Art Animator Tool

**A tool to help you animate pixel art**

This is a simple pixel art animation tool I made inspired by aarthificial's YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsOKwUwL1bE&ab_channel=aarthificial

Please watch the video to understand how the UV mapping works.

Using colour palettes, you can efficiently create different versions of basic animations. This is really use when animating lots of armour/clothes:

Give the animation whatever texture you want using a skin and map:

NOTE: Only .png is supported.

For using this in your own project, you need to draw your own **the_map.png** and **the_skin.png** files that are mapped correctly to the input animation files. 

The input animation files is the template animation that you can texture as you wish. This template animation goes into the **input** folder. Running the program will spit out the output files in the **output** folder.
